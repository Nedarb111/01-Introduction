Hello! This code simply tells other users about who I am. It answers the following questions:

   * What is your name?
   * What is your favorite game?
   * What concerns do you have about this class?
   * What are you excited about (in general)?
   * What is your stackoverflow.com user number?
   * What is the URL to your github.com profile?

The program should show the important parts of each question's answer highlighted in red. The rest of the answer should appear in gray.
